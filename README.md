# ETH-AVAX-Module-3
#Overview
This repository contains a Solidityy contract named ERC20Token.sol. This contract allows the contract owner to mnt tokens to a specified address. It also enables any useer to transfer and burn tokens.

ERC20Token.sol provides three functions:
- ownerMintToken() = allows owner to mint tokens to an address. This function is exclusive to the contract owner.
- userTransferToken() = allows user to transfer tokens to an address
- userBurnToken() = allows user to burn tokens from their own address

#Pre-requisites
To be able to run the contract properly, setting up the following is recommended:
- Remix IDE or any Solidity Compiler that could run version 0.8.0 or higher

#Usage
- Open Remix IDE or your chosen Solidity Compiler.
- Copy and paste the code provided in ERC20Token.sol.
- Compile the contract using Solidity Compiler.
- Deploy the contract using Deploy & Run Transactions.
- Interact with the contract.
